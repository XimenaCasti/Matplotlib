Analysis
This analysis of Pymaceuticals Inc. presents key findings based on the provided data and includes various data visualization and statistical techniques to uncover insights regarding the effectiveness of different drug regimens on tumor growth in mice.

Scatter Plot Analysis
Based on the scatter plot analysis, there appears to be a correlation between mouse weight and tumor volume for mice treated with Capomulin. In other words, as the weight of the mouse increases, there is a tendency for the tumor volume to also increase. This suggests that there may be a relationship between mouse weight and tumor growth in response to Capomulin treatment.

Effectiveness of Drug Regimens
It is evident that Capomulin and Ramicane stand out as the two most effective drugs in minimizing tumor size. These two treatments consistently lead to smaller tumor volumes compared to other drugs. Ramicane appears to be the most potent drug, as it boasts the lowest average final tumor volume. Conversely, Infubinol shows the least favorable outcomes, as it exhibits the highest average final tumor volume.

The code includes: 

1. Summary Statistics
A summary statistics table has been generated, including the mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and standard error of the mean (SEM) of the tumor volume for each drug regimen.

2. Bar and Pie Charts
A bar chart displaying the total number of observed mouse timepoints for each drug regimen using both Pandas and Matplotlib has been created.
A pie chart showing the distribution of female versus male mice in the dataset has been generated using both Pandas and Matplotlib.
3. Quartiles, Outliers, and Boxplots
4. Line and Scatter Plots
5. Correlation and Regression
